  abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are now widely used in Cyber-Physical Systems
    (CPSs), both for sensor data or perception processing and also as neural network
    controllers. However, resource constraints often prevent a full local deployment
    of the DNNs, e.g., on edge devices. Implementing them on the cloud, on the other
    hand, is associated with large delays and large volumes of data transfers. This
    has resulted in the emergence of Split Computing (SC), where a part of the DNN
    is implemented on an edge device and the rest in the cloud. However, how to design
    control strategies with such a setup has not been sufficiently investigated in
    the past. In this paper, we study controller design strategies where state estimates
    from sensor data processed on an edge device are combined with estimates obtained
    from the cloud. While the former is associated with low delays, the state estimates
    have higher errors or uncertainties. The estimates from the cloud, obtained with
    larger DNNs, are, however, delayed. We show that the problem of sizing the DNNs
    on the edge and the cloud can be formulated as an optimization problem with the
    goal of maximizing system safety.

  abstract: Split Computing (SC) enables deploying a Deep Neural Network (DNN) on
    edge devices with limited resources by splitting the workload between the edge
    device and a remote server. However, relying on a server can be expensive, requires
    a reliable network, and introduces unpredictable latency. Existing solutions for
    on-device DNNs deployment often sacrifice accuracy for efficiency. In this paper,
    we study how to use the concepts from SC to split a DNN for executing on the same
    device without compromising accuracy. In other words, we propose Local-Only Split
    Computing (LO-SC), a new approach to split a DNN for execution entirely on the
    edge device while maintaining high accuracy and predictable latency. We formalize
    LO-SC as a MixedInteger Linear Problem (MILP) problem and solve it using a multi-constrained
    ordered knapsack algorithm. The proposed method achieves promising results on
    both synthetic and realworld data, offering a viable alternative for accurately
    deploying DNNs on resource-constrained edge devices. The source code is available
    at https://github.com/intelligolabs/LO-SC.
