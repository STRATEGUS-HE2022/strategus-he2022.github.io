We are pleased to announce the publication of our latest article titled
**"Analog Defect Injection and Fault Simulation Techniques: A Systematic
Literature Review"** in the journal **IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design
of Integrated Circuits and Systems**.

### Abstract

Since the last century, the exponential growth of the semiconductor industry has
led to the creation of tiny and complex integrated circuits, e.g., sensors,
actuators, and smart power. Innovative techniques are needed to ensure the
correct functionality of analog devices that are ubiquitous in every smart
system. The ISO 26262 standard for functional safety in the automotive context
specifies that fault injection is necessary to validate all electronic devices.
For decades, standardization of defect modeling and injection mainly focused on
digital circuits and, in a minor part, on analog ones. An initial attempt is
being made with the IEEE P2427 draft standard that started to give a structured
and formal organization to the analog testing field. Various methods have been
proposed in the literature to speed up the fault simulation of the defect
universe for an analog circuit. A more limited number of papers seek to reduce
the overall simulation time by reducing the number of defects to be simulated.
This literature survey describes the state-of-the-art of analog defect injection
and the fault simulation methods. The survey is based on the preferred reporting
items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) methodological flow,
allowing for a systematic and complete literature survey. Each selected paper
has been categorized and presented to provide an overview of all the available
approaches. In addition, the limitations of the various approaches are discussed
by showing possible future directions.
