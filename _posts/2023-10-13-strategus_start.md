I'm glad to announce that the European Commission has funded the **STRATEGUS** project with a three-year **Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship** (Global Fellowship).

**Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA)** are a set of major research fellowships created by the European Union/European Commission to support research in the European Research Area (ERA). MSCA fellowships are among Europe's most competitive and prestigious awards, aimed at supporting the best and most promising scientists.

The fellowship will allow us to develop the *"STRATEgic GUide to Smart manufacturing"* (STRATEGUS) project. During the three-year project, Enrico will spend 24 months at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and 12 months at the University of Verona. The STRATEGUS project aims at providing understandable techniques and software architectures for guiding industrials towards the proper integration of new technologies in their existing production plants.
