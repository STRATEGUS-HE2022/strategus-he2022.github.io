We are excited to share that our latest conference paper, titled **"Analog Fault
Simulation: Trends and Perspectives in Analog Hardware Description Languages"**,
has been published in the proceedings of the **2024 IEEE Latin American Test
Symposium (LATS)**.

### Abstract

Analog Hardware Description Languages (AHDLs) provide a valuable alternative to
existing proprietary means of implementing defect models and generic templates.
Analog defect modeling in SPICE engines and in event-driven digital simulators
is discussed, with a review of the state-of-the-art, an analysis of
possibilities, and proposals for future enhancements of tools and standards to
meet the challenges of achieving good coverage estimations at the system level.
Moreover, we discuss the possibilities of using the EDACurry open-source
framework to instrument transistor-level analog circuits to support defects
templates written through AHDL, e.g., Verilog-A.

This paper discusses the role of Analog Hardware Description Languages (AHDLs)
as an alternative to proprietary implementations for analog defect modeling and
fault simulation. The study reviews the state-of-the-art in SPICE-based and
event-driven simulators, analyzes current challenges, and proposes enhancements
for achieving better system-level coverage estimations. It also highlights the
use of the open-source EDACurry framework to instrument transistor-level
circuits using AHDLs such as Verilog-A.
