We are excited to announce the publication of our latest conference paper,
titled **"Cross-domain Analog Fault Injection for Designing Robust Smart
Systems"**, in the proceedings of the **2024 Forum on Specification & Design
Languages (FDL)**.

### Abstract

Under the pressure of the Industry 4.0 revolution, and now with the European
Chips Act, smart systems are becoming omnipresent in all industrial sectors,
e.g., automotive and aerospace. Such systems contain digital and analog
components belonging to several physical domains, e.g., electrical and
mechanical. To ensure robustness, the whole system must be validated as early as
possible in the development cycle, by taking into account all such domains, as
recommended by the ISO 26262 standard in the case, e.g., of automotive systems.
Unfortunately, validation techniques, including fault injection and simulation,
are not as advanced on the analog side as the digital counterpart: i) they are
not fully standardized, ii) they are highly domain-dependent, and iii) they are
performed separately from the digital flow. This article proposes to improve the
design of smart systems by generating faulty scenarios through analog fault
injection across several physical domains. By exploiting these faulty scenarios,
it is possible to improve the robustness of the analog part and, at the same
time, to improve the quality of the digital part that controls the system
functionality. A multi-domain case study containing a microcontroller and a
three-axis accelerometer is presented to demonstrate the validity of the
proposed approach in many industrial contexts.

This paper highlights a novel approach to designing robust smart systems by
introducing cross-domain analog fault injection. By generating faulty scenarios
across multiple physical domains, such as electrical and mechanical, the study
demonstrates how system robustness can be improved early in the development
cycle. A multi-domain case study featuring a microcontroller and a three-axis
accelerometer validates the effectiveness of this methodology, showcasing its
applicability in industrial contexts.
