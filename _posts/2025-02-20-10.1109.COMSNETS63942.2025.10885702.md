We are excited to announce the publication of our latest conference paper,
titled **"Controllers for Edge-Cloud Cyber-Physical Systems"**, in the
proceedings of the **2025 International Conference on Communication Systems and
Networks (COMSNETS)**.

### Abstract

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are now widely used in **Cyber-Physical Systems
(CPSs)**, both for sensor data or perception processing and also as **neural
network controllers**. However, resource constraints often prevent a full local
deployment of the DNNs, e.g., on **edge devices**. Implementing them on the
**cloud** is associated with large delays and large volumes of data transfers.
This has resulted in the emergence of **Split Computing (SC)**, where a part of
the DNN is implemented on an edge device and the rest in the cloud.

However, how to **design control strategies** with such a setup has not been
sufficiently investigated in the past. In this paper, we study controller design
strategies where **state estimates** from sensor data processed on an **edge
device** are combined with estimates obtained from the **cloud**. While the
former is associated with **low delays**, the state estimates have **higher
errors or uncertainties**. The estimates from the cloud, obtained with **larger
DNNs**, are, however, **delayed**.

We show that the problem of **sizing the DNNs** on the edge and the cloud can be
formulated as an **optimization problem** with the goal of **maximizing system
safety**.

This paper explores **controller design strategies for edge-cloud Cyber-Physical
Systems (CPSs)** by leveraging **Split Computing (SC)** to balance computation
between **edge devices** and the **cloud**. The research investigates trade-offs
between **low-latency but noisy state estimates from edge devices** and
**delayed but more accurate estimates from cloud-based models**. The proposed
**optimization framework** aims to **maximize system safety** while efficiently
allocating computational resources.
