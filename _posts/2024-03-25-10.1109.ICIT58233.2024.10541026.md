We are excited to announce that our conference paper titled **"A Data Fusion
Service-Oriented Infrastructure for Production Line Monitoring"** has been
published in the proceedings of the **2024 IEEE International Conference on
Industrial Technology (ICIT)**.

### Abstract

The Industry 4.0 paradigm has deeply changed classical manufacturing by
introducing data-based analytics and decision-support strategies. At the state
of the art, data used for manufacturing monitoring is mostly originated by
sensors, that undergo a fusion step to align different data sources. However,
this data is only relative to the monitored process, and it does not include the
corresponding operating conditions and parameters, that are known by the
Manufacturing Execution System (MES). Such information is currently either not
included or labeled by hand, thus incurring in errors and limiting the amount of
available labeled data. To overcome this issue and go beyond the sole data
fusion of sensor data, this paper proposes an infrastructure that automatically
labels time series generated by sensors with information extracted from the MES,
to achieve enhanced monitoring of the production process. The relevance of the
proposed solution and the possibilities opened by its application are stressed
with the application to a robotic arm.

This paper presents a novel infrastructure for enhancing production line
monitoring by combining sensor data with information from the Manufacturing
Execution System (MES). By automatically labeling time series data with MES
information, the proposed solution reduces manual errors and increases the
availability of labeled data for process monitoring and anomaly detection. Its
effectiveness is demonstrated with a case study involving a robotic arm.
