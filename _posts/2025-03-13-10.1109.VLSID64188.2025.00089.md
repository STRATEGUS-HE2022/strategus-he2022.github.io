We are excited to announce that our latest conference paper, titled **"LO-SC: Local-Only Split Computing for Accurate Deep Learning on Edge Devices"**, has been published in the proceedings of the **2025 International Conference on VLSI Design (VLSID)**.

### Abstract

Split Computing (SC) enables deploying a Deep Neural Network (DNN) on edge devices with limited resources by splitting the workload between the edge device and a remote server. However, relying on a server can be expensive, requires a reliable network, and introduces unpredictable latency. Existing solutions for on-device DNN deployment often sacrifice accuracy for efficiency. In this paper, we study how to use the concepts from SC to split a DNN for execution on the same device without compromising accuracy. In other words, we propose **Local-Only Split Computing (LO-SC)**, a new approach to split a DNN for execution entirely on the edge device while maintaining high accuracy and predictable latency. We formalize LO-SC as a **Mixed Integer Linear Problem (MILP)** and solve it using a **multi-constrained ordered knapsack algorithm**. The proposed method achieves promising results on both synthetic and real-world data, offering a viable alternative for accurately deploying DNNs on resource-constrained edge devices.

This paper introduces **Local-Only Split Computing (LO-SC)**, a novel technique for deploying deep learning models on edge devices without requiring a remote server. By applying a **multi-constrained knapsack optimization**, the approach allows for **efficient, accurate, and low-latency execution** of deep neural networks while ensuring predictable performance.
