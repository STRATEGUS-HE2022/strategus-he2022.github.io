Production manufacturing has drastically changed in the last decade, year after
year, it became more complex and tightly integrated with new technologies. The
application of new technologies can be safely and properly done during the
initial design phases of a new production plant. However, one of the key
challenges of this so-called “fourth industrial revolution” is that it must be
applied to existing production plants, introducing much more complexity. The
goal of **STRATEGUS** (**STRATE**gic **GU**ide to **S**mart manufacturing) is to
provide understandable techniques and software architecture for guiding
industrials towards the proper integration of new technologies in their current
production plant.

STRATEGUS will build the so-called digital twin, a digital representation of the
factory plant, that functions as an interface to the sensor data and contains
mathematical models of the equipment. The digital twin provides a structured
view of sensor data, allowing one to perform timing analysis, make future
predictions, and adjust the control strategy. Then, the main orchestrator will
be Strategist, a meta-scheduler that has a twofold purpose: 1. estimating the
timing behaviour of the events inside the physical plant by harnessing the power
of the digital twin, and 2. optimising the activities on the line based on order
arrival and reacting to unexpected events and accidents. STRATEGUS takes
inspiration for describing the models inside the twin from the theory of
multimode systems, where each piece of equipment is modelled as a set of
differential or difference equations describing how they manipulate the
products’ characteristics until it reaches the state of the finished product.
